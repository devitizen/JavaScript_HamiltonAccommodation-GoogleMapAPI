# This application has two more features we did not go over with in-class examples.
One is providing the direction options of walking, bicycling, transit as well as driving. 
You can find the route between two places by selecting the travel mode. 
The other is Google street view. 
Clicking the View street button in the info window will show the street view of the place selected.
